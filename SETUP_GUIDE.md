## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### 1. Gmail App Password Setup

**Why App Password?**
Gmail doesn't allow apps to use your regular password for security reasons. You need a special 16-character "App Password".

**How to Get It:**

1. **Go to Google Account Settings**
   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/security

2. **Enable 2-Step Verification**
   - If not already enabled, you must enable it first
   - Follow the prompts to set up 2FA

3. **Generate App Password**
   - Scroll down to "App passwords" section
   - Click on it (you may need to re-enter your password)
   - Select app: **Mail**
   - Select device: **Windows Computer** (or other)
   - Click **Generate**

4. **Copy the Password**
   - You'll see a 16-character password like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
   - Copy this password (spaces don't matter)
   - You won't be able to see it again!

5. **Save It Securely**
   - You'll enter this in the dashboard
   - It will be saved in `config.json`

### 2. Prepare Your Email Data

Create an Excel or CSV file with these columns:

**Required Columns:**
- `To` - Recipient email address
- `Subject` - Email subject line
- `Body` - Email message content

**Optional Columns:**
- `CC` - Carbon copy email addresses
- `BCC` - Blind carbon copy email addresses
- `Attachment` - Full path to attachment file

**Example:**

| To | Subject | Body | CC |
|----|---------|------|----|
| john@example.com | Meeting Reminder | Hi John, don't forget our meeting tomorrow at 10 AM. | manager@example.com |
| sarah@example.com | Project Update | Hi Sarah, here's the latest update on the project. | |

**Save as:** `emails.xlsx` or `emails.csv`

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Problem: Can't activate virtual environment

**Error:** `cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled`

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then try activating again:
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

---

### Problem: "No module named flask" or similar import errors

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Problem: "535 Authentication failed" or login error

**Causes:**
- Using regular Gmail password (won't work!)
- App Password not generated correctly
- 2-Factor Authentication not enabled

**Solution:**
1. Enable 2FA on your Google account
2. Generate a new App Password
3. Copy the EXACT 16-character password
4. Enter it in Email Config section (spaces don't matter)
5. Click Save Configuration
6. Try sending again

---

### Problem: File upload fails - "Missing required columns"

**Solution:**
Make sure your Excel/CSV has these exact column names (case-sensitive):
- `To` (not "Email" or "to")
- `Subject` (not "subject")
- `Body` (not "Message" or "body")

Rename your columns in Excel if needed.

---

### Problem: Google Sheet won't load

**Causes:**
- Sheet is not publicly accessible
- Wrong link format

**Solution:**
1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Click "Share" ‚Üí "Change to anyone with the link"
3. Copy the share link (not the edit link)
4. Paste in dashboard
5. Try again

---

### Problem: Attachment not found

**Error:** "Attachment not found: C:\path\to\file.pdf"

**Solution:**
- Use full absolute paths in your Excel file
- Example: `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\file.pdf`
- Make sure file exists at that exact location
- Use forward slashes `/` or double backslashes `\\`
  - Good: `C:/Users/Name/file.pdf`
  - Good: `C:\\Users\\Name\\file.pdf`
  - Bad: `C:\Users\Name\file.pdf` (might fail)

---

### Problem: Dashboard won't load / Connection refused

**Check:**
1. Is Flask running? (check terminal)
2. See any errors in terminal?
3. Try: http://localhost:5000 instead of 127.0.0.1
4. Check if port 5000 is already in use

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Stop the app (Ctrl+C)
# Start again
python app.py
```

---

### Problem: Browser shows "This site can't be reached"

**Solution:**
1. Check Flask is running (terminal should show "Running on...")
2. Make sure you're using the correct URL:
   - http://127.0.0.1:5000 or
   - http://localhost:5000
3. Try a different browser
4. Disable VPN if using one

---

## üéì Advanced Usage

### Using the Original CLI Version

The original `main.py` still works independently:

```powershell
# Make sure data.xlsx exists in the same directory
python main.py
```

This bypasses the dashboard and runs the original script.

---

### Custom SMTP Server (Non-Gmail)

If using a different email provider:

1. Go to Email Config section
2. Change SMTP Server (e.g., `smtp.outlook.com`, `smtp.yahoo.com`)
3. Change SMTP Port (e.g., 587, 465, 25)
4. Use your provider's app password
5. Save configuration

---

### Batch Processing Tips

**For Large Lists:**
1. Test with 5-10 emails first
2. Check logs for any errors
3. Fix any issues
4. Then send to full list

**Gmail Limits:**
- Free Gmail: ~500 emails per day
- Google Workspace: ~2,000 emails per day
- Spread sending across multiple days if needed

---

### Backup Configuration

Your config is saved in `config.json`:
```powershell
# Copy to backup
copy config.json config.backup.json
```

---

### Running on Network

To access from other devices on your network:

1. Find your computer's IP address:
```powershell
ipconfig
```
Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

2. The app already runs on 0.0.0.0, so just access:
```
http://YOUR_IP:5000
```
Example: http://192.168.1.100:5000

---

### Scheduling Automated Sends

Use Windows Task Scheduler to run at specific times:

1. Create a batch file `auto_send.bat`:
```batch
@echo off
cd /d "C:\path\to\Email-Automation-main"
call venv\Scripts\activate.bat
python main.py
```

2. Open Task Scheduler
3. Create Basic Task
4. Set schedule (daily, weekly, etc.)
5. Action: Start a program
6. Program: Path to your `auto_send.bat`

## üìä Data Privacy & Security

### What Gets Stored?

**Locally on Your Computer:**
- `config.json` - Your email credentials
- `static/uploads/` - Uploaded Excel/CSV files
- In-memory logs (cleared when app stops)

**Not Stored Anywhere:**
- No cloud services
- No external databases
- No tracking
- All data stays on your machine

### Protect Your Data

1. **Add to `.gitignore`** (already done):
   - config.json
   - *.xlsx
   - *.csv
   - static/uploads/

2. **Don't share:**
   - Your config.json file
   - Your App Password
   - Files with email addresses

3. **Secure your computer:**
   - Use strong password
   - Enable BitLocker if available
   - Regular backups
